                <p>" are you a freak" lowk yea but id rather lay on ur chest while u tell me everything that u dislike about yourself and i tell u why i love it
                     I am not sure how or when it happened. But all of a sudden, you were everything to me,  you are in the air that i  breathe, the hunger in my gut, the thirst on my tongue, the fever that festers beneath my skin, the story i can’t stop reading, the prayer i can’t stop whispering.

I appreciate all the little things you do to make me happy and feel so important. For you I'll always stay up till 4 in the morning just to talk to you even if then I'll have to wake up late. I hope you stay around for a long , longggg time

Don't just tell me your dreams and what drives you, tell me your nightmares and the things that hold you back. Give me your body, but also show me your scars. I'm not here just to hold your hand but I'm also here to understand. I'll pick you up, I'll brace your fall. Don't let me just walk beside you in the sunshine, let me hold you through the storm. Give me all of you, let me love you true, every single piece that makes you , you.</p>

                <p>I'm not perfect, i make mistakes. I have jealousy, attachment , separation and trust issues. I can also be moody sometimes but anshul i promise you that if I say i love you, i mean it. I'm faithful, I'm loyal and dedicated to you. I will do everything I can to keep you. Don't confuse my caring for controlling or my actions for being cringe or weak. Don't make me put in all the effort. Don't ignore me. Love me back like you mean it or don't stay. Together, we're strong enough to overcome the worst of the worst. Alone, we struggle to find meaning. If we don't grow together , we grow apart</p>
